  "summary": "Implemented profile-fetch hard timeout and added startup-stage diagnostics/error UI, plus updated App startup stage tracking and a 30s watchdog to avoid indefinite loading. Also includes unrelated changes to Membership checkout flow and URL/session parameter utilities not requested by the BuildRequest.",

    {
      "description": "Changes to MembershipPage checkout flow (pricing selection, redirect handling, toggle for annual billing, Stripe session handling)",
      "reason": "BuildRequest is focused on fixing infinite 'Loading your profile' startup state and explicitly lists redesigning unrelated pages (including membership) as a non-goal; these changes appear unrelated to the profile-loading hang.",

    {
      "description": "Added/expanded URL parameter + sessionStorage utilities (route path parsing, persisted URL parameters, storing/removing session parameters) including comments about maintaining sensitive state",
      "reason": "Not requested by any REQ-1..REQ-4; BuildRequest scope is startup/profile loading behavior. This looks like additional infrastructure beyond what was requested.",
