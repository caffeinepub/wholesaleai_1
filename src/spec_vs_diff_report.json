  "summary": "The diff introduces new sidebar-related CSS tokens and a `.sidebar-nav-button` class intended to make sidebar buttons opaque, but the provided changes do not clearly demonstrate the full REQ-1 acceptance criteria (consistent default/hover/focus/active states across desktop + mobile sidebar). There are also unrelated changes (URL/session parameter utilities and project state metadata) not requested by the styling-only BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Ensure all sidebar navigation buttons/links render as solid, filled-in buttons with clear borders and consistent default/hover/focus/active states in both light and dark mode, for both desktop sidebar and mobile sidebar sheet.",
      "reason": "While `frontend/src/index.css` adds sidebar color tokens and a `.sidebar-nav-button` rule to remove backdrop filtering, the diff does not show concrete implementation of consistent default/hover/focus/active state styling (including borders) applied to all sidebar items, nor does it provide verifiable evidence that the same styling is applied in the mobile sidebar Sheet as required. `frontend/src/components/AppShell.tsx` is truncated, so the necessary class usage/state styling cannot be confirmed from the diff summary.",
