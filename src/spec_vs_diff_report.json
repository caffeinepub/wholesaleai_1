  "summary": "Diff implements responsive sidebar behavior (mobile drawer + auto-close on nav) and adds an app-shell error boundary plus lazy-loaded page rendering logic. One explicit gap is that the Admin Panel navigation item is not evidenced in the sidebar nav list, despite being required. Diff also includes additional routing/startup watchdog changes not explicitly requested by the BuildRequest.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Sidebar must include and support navigation to Admin Panel (along with Dashboard, Deal Analyzer, Deals Pipeline, Buyers List, Contracts, Analytics, Membership) such that clicking it updates active state and renders the correct page in the main content.",
      "reason": "The modified AppShell navItems list shown includes dashboard/analyzer/pipeline/buyers/contracts/analytics/membership but does not show an Admin Panel item, so there is no evidence that Admin Panel can be selected from the sidebar as required.",
