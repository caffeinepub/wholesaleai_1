  "summary": "Implements a redesigned SignInScreen with a card-based premium layout, introduces a shared StartupLoadingScreen for initialization/profile-loading states, applies an orange/amber accent theme via CSS variables, and updates ProfileSetupDialog to be non-dismissible (outside click/escape) with improved copy and error UI. Some REQ-1 acceptance details cannot be confirmed due to truncation of ProfileSetupDialog changes.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Primary CTA is disabled until name is non-empty.",
      "reason": "The diff shows `isNameValid` being computed, but the (truncated) Button/CTA markup is not visible, so there is no evidence the submit button is actually disabled based on name input.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/ProfileSetupDialog.tsx (truncated)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Submission shows an in-button loading state (existing pending behavior preserved).",
      "reason": "The diff does not include the submit button rendering; therefore there is no evidence of an in-button loading spinner/text while `saveProfile` is pending.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/ProfileSetupDialog.tsx (truncated)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "UI clearly indicates success by closing the dialog once the profile is saved.",
      "reason": "Dialog is hard-coded `open={true}` and the portion that would react to a successful save (e.g., clearing state, calling close, or relying on parent unmount) is not shown in the truncated diff, so closure-on-success cannot be verified from provided evidence.",

      "description": "Forces dark mode by adding `dark` class to `document.documentElement` on mount.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest asked for a coherent startup theme and explicitly avoiding blue/purple accents, but did not request forcing dark mode globally regardless of user/system preference.",

        "frontend/src/App.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Introduces `next-themes` ThemeProvider wrapping around App routes.",
