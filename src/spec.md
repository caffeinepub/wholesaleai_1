# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make all sidebar navigation items render as clearly filled-in, solid-color buttons with polished, consistent styling across light/dark mode and desktop/mobile sidebars.

**Planned changes:**
- Update sidebar navigation item styling (background fill, borders, spacing/shape if needed) so buttons are solid (non-transparent) in both light and dark mode.
- Define consistent visual states for sidebar items (default, hover, focus, active) across all links/buttons including Dashboard, Contracts, Admin Panel, Contact Support, and Sign Out.
- Apply the same filled button styling to the mobile sidebar Sheet navigation as well as the desktop sidebar, without changing backend logic or any immutable frontend paths.

**User-visible outcome:** Sidebar navigation items appear as clearly colored, filled-in buttons with consistent hover/active/focus feedback in both light and dark mode on desktop and mobile.
